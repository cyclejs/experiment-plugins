# Cycle HTML - [source](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/html)

A Cycle.js driver to render virtual DOM streams as HTML. This is based on the DOM driver and [snabbdom](https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom/), and is intended for server-side rendered HTML that mirrors what the DOM driver would render client-side.

```
npm install @cycle/html
